# NEO_SHERXE project for NASA Space Apps 2024 Cairo Hackathon

## Overview

Orrery Simulation is a React-based 3D visualization tool that models the solar system's planets orbiting around the Sun. Utilizing Three.js and React Three Fiber, this project allows users to view and interact with a dynamic model of the solar system, observing the orbital mechanics of each planet.

## Features

- **3D Solar System Visualization:** Interactive 3D model of the solar system with the Sun and planets.
- **Dynamic Orbits:** Simulate the planets' orbits around the Sun based on orbital parameters.
- **Real-Time Simulation Control:** Adjust simulation time and speed with interactive controls.
- **Planet Information:** Click on planets to navigate to detailed views.

## Technologies

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Three.js:** For rendering 3D graphics.
- **React Three Fiber:** A React renderer for Three.js.
- **React Router DOM:** For navigation between different views.
